class Context(discord.abc.Messageable, Generic[BotT]):
    r"""Represents the context in which a command is being invoked under.

    This class contains a lot of meta data to help you understand more about
    the invocation context. This class is not created manually and is instead
    passed around to commands as the first parameter.

    This class implements the :class:`~discord.abc.Messageable` ABC.

    Attributes
    -----------
    message: :class:`.Message`
        The message that triggered the command being executed.

        .. note::

            In the case of an interaction based context, this message is "synthetic"
            and does not actually exist. Therefore, the ID on it is invalid similar
            to ephemeral messages.
    bot: :class:`.Bot`
        The bot that contains the command being executed.
    args: :class:`list`
        The list of transformed arguments that were passed into the command.
        If this is accessed during the :func:`.on_command_error` event
        then this list could be incomplete.
    kwargs: :class:`dict`
        A dictionary of transformed arguments that were passed into the command.
        Similar to :attr:`args`\, if this is accessed in the
        :func:`.on_command_error` event then this dict could be incomplete.
    current_parameter: Optional[:class:`Parameter`]
        The parameter that is currently being inspected and converted.
        This is only of use for within converters.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    current_argument: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The argument string of the :attr:`current_parameter` that is currently being converted.
        This is only of use for within converters.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    interaction: Optional[:class:`~discord.Interaction`]
        The interaction associated with this context.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    prefix: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The prefix that was used to invoke the command. For interaction based contexts,
        this is ``/`` for slash commands and ``\u200b`` for context menu commands.
    command: Optional[:class:`Command`]
        The command that is being invoked currently.
    invoked_with: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The command name that triggered this invocation. Useful for finding out
        which alias called the command.
    invoked_parents: List[:class:`str`]
        The command names of the parents that triggered this invocation. Useful for
        finding out which aliases called the command.

        For example in commands ``?a b c test``, the invoked parents are ``['a', 'b', 'c']``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7

    invoked_subcommand: Optional[:class:`Command`]
        The subcommand that was invoked.
        If no valid subcommand was invoked then this is equal to ``None``.
    subcommand_passed: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The string that was attempted to call a subcommand. This does not have
        to point to a valid registered subcommand and could just point to a
        nonsense string. If nothing was passed to attempt a call to a
        subcommand then this is set to ``None``.
    command_failed: :class:`bool`
        A boolean that indicates if the command failed to be parsed, checked,
        or invoked.

        """|coro|

        Creates a context from a :class:`discord.Interaction`. This only
        works on application command based interactions, such as slash commands
        or context menus.

        On slash command based interactions this creates a synthetic :class:`~discord.Message`
        that points to an ephemeral message that the command invoker has executed. This means
        that :attr:`Context.author` returns the member that invoked the command.

        In a message context menu based interaction, the :attr:`Context.message` attribute
        is the message that the command is being executed on. This means that :attr:`Context.author`
        returns the author of the message being targetted. To get the member that invoked
        the command then :attr:`discord.Interaction.user` should be used instead.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0

        Parameters
        -----------
        interaction: :class:`discord.Interaction`
            The interaction to create a context with.

        Raises
        -------
        ValueError
            The interaction does not have a valid command.

        Calls a command with the arguments given.

        This is useful if you want to just call the callback that a
        :class:`.Command` holds internally.

        .. note::

            This does not handle converters, checks, cooldowns, pre-invoke,
            or after-invoke hooks in any matter. It calls the internal callback
            directly as-if it was a regular function.

            using this function.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0

            ``command`` parameter is now positional-only.

        Parameters
        -----------
        command: :class:`.Command`
            The command that is going to be called.
        \*args
            The arguments to use.

        """|coro|

        Calls the command again.

        This is similar to :meth:`~.Context.invoke` except that it bypasses
        checks, cooldowns, and error handlers.

        .. note::

            If you want to bypass :exc:`.UserInputError` derived exceptions,
            it is recommended to use the regular :meth:`~.Context.invoke`
            as it will work more naturally. After all, this will end up
            using the old arguments the user has used and will thus just
            fail again.

        Parameters
        ------------
        call_hooks: :class:`bool`
            Whether to call the before and after invoke hooks.
        restart: :class:`bool`
            Whether to start the call chain from the very beginning
            or where we left off (i.e. the command that caused the error).
            The default is to start where we left off.

        does not do any typing calls.

        Example Usage: ::

        file: :class:`~discord.File`
            The file to upload.
        files: List[:class:`~discord.File`]
            A list of files to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
        nonce: :class:`int`
            The nonce to use for sending this message. If the message was successfully sent,

        delete_after: :class:`float`
            If provided, the number of seconds to wait in the background
            before deleting the message we just sent. If the deletion fails,
            then it is silently ignored. This is ignored for interaction based contexts.
        allowed_mentions: :class:`~discord.AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is
