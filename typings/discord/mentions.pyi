    This class can be set during :class:`Client` initialisation to apply
    to every message sent. It can also be applied on a per message basis
    via :meth:`abc.Messageable.send` for more fine-grained control.

    Attributes
    ------------
    everyone: :class:`bool`
        Whether to allow everyone and here mentions. Defaults to ``True``.
    users: Union[:class:`bool`, List[:class:`abc.Snowflake`]]
        Controls the users being mentioned. If ``True`` (the default) then
        users are mentioned based on the message content. If ``False`` then
        users are not mentioned at all. If a list of :class:`abc.Snowflake`
        is given then only the users provided will be mentioned, provided those
        users are in the message content.
    roles: Union[:class:`bool`, List[:class:`abc.Snowflake`]]
        Controls the roles being mentioned. If ``True`` (the default) then
        roles are mentioned based on the message content. If ``False`` then
        roles are not mentioned at all. If a list of :class:`abc.Snowflake`
        is given then only the roles provided will be mentioned, provided those
        roles are in the message content.
    replied_user: :class:`bool`
        Whether to mention the author of the message being replied to. Defaults
        to ``True``.
