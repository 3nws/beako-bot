Notifies when a new chapter of the Re:Zero web novel is translated.

Checks every 10 minutes.

For now it uses a text channel as a database being set as an environment variable.

```
CHANNEL_ID
```

I get the data from [WitchCultTranslation](https://witchculttranslation.com/).

## Commands

- r.avatar (shows a user's avatar or the op's if no argument is passed)
- r.add_channel (adds the text channel to the list that will receive notifications)
