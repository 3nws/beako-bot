Notifies when a new chapter of the Re:Zero web novel is translated.

Checks every 10 seconds.

I get the data from [WitchCultTranslation](https://witchculttranslation.com/).

## Commands

- r.avatar (shows a user's avatar or the op's if no argument is passed)
- r.add_channel (adds the text channel to the list that will receive notifications)

### TODO

- add delete_channel command
- delete channel_id from db when a channel is deleted.
